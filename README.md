## 📚 Data Analysis Projects
- **ANALYZING THE PARTICIPATION LEVEL OF POULTRY FARMERS IN AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA**
   *This project explores factors influencing the low participation of poultry farmers in agricultural insurance across 7 Northern Nigerian states. It involves data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visual insights using Excel and Power BI. Socio-economic characteristics such as income, education, and farm size were analyzed to determine their effect on insurance uptake.*

- **SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, FARMING PRACTICES, AND PRODUCTIVITY OF MAIZE FARMERS IN KENYA (BUNGOMA COUNTY)**  
  *This project analyzes data from a field survey conducted in four sub-counties of Bungoma County—Chwele, Sirisia, Tongaren, and Webuye West. It explores how socio-economic characteristics, farming practices, and access to agricultural support impact maize productivity in the region.*

- **THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE EXPECTATIONS AND SECTORAL DIFFERENCES ON FOOD PRICES IN NIGERIA**  
  *This project examines the relationship between climate change expectations and food price variations across Nigeria. By analyzing data on climate perceptions, sectoral differences (urban vs rural), and food price trends, the study sheds light on how these factors shape the agricultural market and food security in the country.*

-**🌍 QUANTIFYING THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF CLIMATE-INDUCED HEALTH RISKS IN NIGERIA**

*This project examines how climate-induced health risks (CIHR)—such as heat stress, malaria, and cholera—affect labour productivity and food security in Nigerian agricultural households. It applies econometric modeling using OLS and logistic regression on nationally representative GHS-Panel data, supported with visual and policy-driven insights.*
